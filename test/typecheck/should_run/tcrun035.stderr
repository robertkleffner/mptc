    Couldn't match expected type `IO a'
                with actual type `forall (m :: * -> *). Monad m => m a'
      Expected type: (forall (m :: * -> *). Monad m => m a) -> IO a
        Actual type: (forall (m :: * -> *). Monad m => m a)
                     -> forall (m :: * -> *). Monad m => m a
    In the second argument of `(.)', namely `id'
    In the expression: id . id
