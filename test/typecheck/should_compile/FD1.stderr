    Could not deduce (a ~ (Int -> Int))
    from the context (E a (Int -> Int))
      bound by the type signature for
                 plus :: E a (Int -> Int) => Int -> a
      at FD1.hs:16:1-16
      `a' is a rigid type variable bound by
          the type signature for plus :: E a (Int -> Int) => Int -> a
          at FD1.hs:16:1
    The equation(s) for `plus' have two arguments,
    but its type `Int -> a' has only one
