    Couldn't match type `a' with `([Char], a)'
      `a' is a rigid type variable bound by
          the type signature for translate :: (String, a) -> A a
          at FD3.hs:15:1
    When using functional dependencies to combine
      MkA a a,
        arising from the dependency `a -> b'
        in the instance declaration at FD3.hs:12:10
      MkA ([Char], a) a, arising from a use of `mkA' at FD3.hs:15:15-17
    In the expression: mkA a
    In an equation for `translate': translate a = mkA a
